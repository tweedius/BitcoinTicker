# BitcoinTicker

An ESP8266 based Bitcoin Ticker using the Arduino development environment and displayed on an ILI9341 display.

Update Feb 13, 2016 - This project is still in the mid development stages.  Most of what is displayed is still in a design mode and not anywhere close to finished.  However it works and it is stable.
